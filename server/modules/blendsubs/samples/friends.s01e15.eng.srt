1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:03,694
Coffee.

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,299
- Thank you.
- Cappuccino.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,632
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,538
Thank you.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,709
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,286
That's why.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,721
Sorry.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,354
The One With The Stoned Guy

9
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,845
Chandler?

10
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,315
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.

11
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,080
That is a very flattering
sleeve length on you.

12
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:36,154
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office today.

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,696
If it's about those prank memos,
I wasn't involved.

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,834
Nothing at all. Really.

15
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,967
And frankly, those shenanigans have
no place in an office environment.

16
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,517
Hey, you guys!

17
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,585
Chandler's coming and
he has incredible news.

18
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,291
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know

19
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,789
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

20
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,161
What's going on?

21
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,093
So it's a typical day at work...

22
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:19,271
...and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

23
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,631
- That is great!
- Congratulations!

24
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,070
So I quit.

25
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,942
Why?

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,273
Why? This was a temp job.

27
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,379
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

28
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,816
I know, but if I took it, I'd be
admitting that this is what I do.

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:41,085
Does that mean we have to start buying
our own toilet paper?

30
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,752
That was Joey Tribbiani
with the big picture. Dan?

31
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,763
Was it more money?

32
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:51,528
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office...

33
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,729
...worrying about the WENUS.

34
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,570
The "WENUS"?

35
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,674
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

36
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,313
Oh, that WENUS.

37
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,113
What will you do?

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,654
I don't know. But I won't
figure it out working there.

39
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,086
I have something you can do!

40
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,626
I have this new massage client, Steve.

41
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,927
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant...

42
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,602
...and he's looking for a head chef.

43
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,205
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

44
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,901
I know. You're a chef
and I thought of you first.

45
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,774
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so....

46
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,310
I just don't have a lot
of chef-ing experience.

47
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,615
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

48
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,457
What is he looking for?

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,890
He wants to do something eclectic.

50
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,658
He's looking for someone
who can create the entire menu.

51
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,697
So, what do you think?

52
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,671
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big, white hat.

53
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,472
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

54
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,775
a perfect run-up
and there he goes, a perfect....

55
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,682
Watch stuff like this...

56
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,346
...and you realize
why evolution is just a theory.

57
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:28,392
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

58
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,970
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

59
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,639
Where are you going?

60
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:40,837
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

61
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,641
- I added the "a-go-go."
- Career counselor?

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,784
You guys all know
what you want to do.

63
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,318
I don't.

64
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,584
You guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

65
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,591
You have goals. You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!

66
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,198
The lesser-known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

67
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,698
I love my life! I love my life!

68
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,633
"Brian's Song"!

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,274
- The meeting went great?
- So great!

70
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,573
He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

71
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,082
It's not too big or too small.
It's just right.

72
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,289
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

73
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,891
I'm cooking for him Monday,
kind of an audition.

74
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,825
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great. You can make yummy noises.

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,331
- What are you gonna make?
- Yummy noises.

76
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:42,306
- And Monica, what are you gonna make?
- I don't know. It's gotta be great.

77
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,772
I know what you can make!
I know!

78
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,037
You should make that thing
with the stuff.

79
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,415
You know that thing with the stuff?

80
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,612
Okay, I don't know.

81
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,887
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

82
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:05,463
How about Tony's? If you finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

83
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,831
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

84
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,670
- Who are you going out with?
- Is this the bug lady?

85
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,471
"I love you, Ross."

86
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:26,082
Her name is Celia and
she's insect curator at the museum.

87
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,316
- What are you gonna do?
- Go out to dinner...

88
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:36,018
...then bring her back to my place
and introduce her to my monkey.

89
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,093
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

90
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:48,567
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe....

91
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,671
Well, I don't know....

92
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,245
I'm hoping....

93
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,210
That monkey is a chick magnet.

94
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:04,219
She'll take one look at his cute,
little face and it'll seal the deal.

95
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,094
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

96
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,320
Soothing tones.

97
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,067
- Here, Marcel.
- I can't stand this.

98
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,171
- He's got his claws on my
- Yeah, all right.

99
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,011
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

100
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,915
Good.

101
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,111
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

102
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:40,156
- It's creamier.
- Yeah? Well, is that better?

103
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,386
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

104
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,425
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

105
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,801
God, what happened to you?

106
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,976
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...

107
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,477
...intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

108
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:09,019
"You're suited for data processing for
a large multinational corporation."

109
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,623
That's so great!
You already know how to do that.

110
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,989
Can you believe it?

111
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,664
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something cool?

112
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,833
I just always pictured myself
doing something....

113
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,296
Something!

114
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,539
Chandler, I know, I know.

115
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,440
Hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

116
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,811
Maybe this will cheer you up.

117
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:44,156
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

118
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,656
It's supposed to be small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

119
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,988
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

120
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,693
Well, it is amusing.

121
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,970
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

122
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,643
What did we say, $10 an hour?

123
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,411
Okay, great.
All right, I'll see you then.

124
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,886
- $10 an hour for what?
- A waitress from work is helping me.

125
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,186
Waitressing?

126
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,593
Of course I thought of you.
But....

127
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,792
- But....
- But, but....

128
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:37,237
But it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know?

129
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,639
Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

130
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:50,012
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

131
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:57,620
I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

132
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,629
Took home a bronze.

133
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,597
Amuse-bouche?

134
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,616
Talk to me.

135
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,792
A weird thing happened
on the train this morning

136
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,963
Talk dirty.

137
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,234
- Here?
- Come on. Come on.

138
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,037
Say something hot.

139
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,579
What? What?

140
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,257
Vulva.

141
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,571
Vulva?

142
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,105
I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.

143
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,213
But it wasn't a total loss.
We ended up cuddling.

144
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,976
You cuddled? How many times?

145
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,914
Shut up. It was nice.

146
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,182
I don't think
I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.

147
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:38,125
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,697
Or what other people
might be doing to each other.

149
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,132
I'll tell you what.
Try something on me.

150
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,268
Please be kidding.

151
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,904
Why not?

152
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:58,548
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

153
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,956
I'm in my apartment....

154
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,926
- Yeah, what else?
- You're not there.

155
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:16,125
- We're not having this conversation.
- All right, I'll start. Ready?

156
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,963
Oh, Ross...

157
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,273
...you get me so hot.
I want your lips on me now.

158
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,076
- Now you say something.
- I really don't think so.

159
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,947
You like this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?

160
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:42,491
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

161
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,255
Now tell me
you wanna caress my butt!

162
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,402
Okay, turn around.

163
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,305
I don't want you staring at me.

164
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,202
All right, I'm not looking.
Go ahead.

165
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,104
Okay.

166
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,245
I want
Okay, I want...

167
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:10,047
...to feel your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

168
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:15,250
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.

169
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,593
I want to take my tongue and

170
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,268
Say it.

171
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,073
Say it!

172
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,477
run it all over your body...

173
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,081
...until you're trembling with

174
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,135
With?

175
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,543
- Funny story.
- You're not gonna believe this.

176
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,949
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

177
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,352
- The trembling thing was nice.
- Shut up!

178
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,621
That guy from your old job
called again.

179
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,098
- Again?
- And again and again and again.

180
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,937
And again.

181
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:41,876
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

182
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,975
Yeah, I miss you too.

183
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,552
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

184
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,248
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.

185
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,988
I need more than a job.
I need something I really care ab

186
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,390
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

187
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,932
Your dream!

188
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,604
Look, Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

189
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,765
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

190
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,568
Stop saying numbers!

191
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,181
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy!

192
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,977
I'll see you Monday!

193
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:39,437
Wow! It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

194
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,797
This is a cube!

195
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,333
Look at this.

196
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,314
You have a window!

197
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,712
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautiful view of

198
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,854
Look! That guy's peeing!

199
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,021
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

200
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,592
Okay, sit down here.

201
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,128
This is great.

202
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,724
- You ready?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,463
Helen, could you come in here?

204
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,442
Thank you, Helen. That'll be all.

205
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,040
Last time I do that.
I promise.

206
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,090
- She doesn't seem very warm.
- I know. She has no personality.

207
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,921
Wendy, don't do this to me.

208
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,694
We had a deal.
Yeah, you promised.

209
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:56,042
- Who was that?
- Wendy bailed.

210
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,112
I have no waitress.

211
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:04,221
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.

212
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,051
Ten dollars an hour!
Twelve dollars an hour!

213
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,897
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

214
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,226
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there.

215
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,404
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing....

216
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,540
Twenty dollars an hour.

217
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,799
Done.

218
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,347
Hello. Welcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?

219
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,426
- Hi, Steve.
- Hello, Monica.

220
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,925
Hello, greeter girl.

221
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,490
- This is Rachel.
- Yeah, okay.

222
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,128
Everything smells so delicious.

223
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,636
I can't remember ever smelling
such a delicious combination of

224
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,103
Okay, smells.

225
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,104
- It's a lovely apartment.
- Thank you. Would you like a tour?

226
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,478
I was just being polite,
but all right.

227
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,052
- What's up?
- In the cab on the way over...

228
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,657
...Steve blazed up a doobie.

229
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,392
What?

230
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,999
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja

231
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,402
I'm with you, Cheech.

232
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:32,000
- Do you think he's gonna be cool?
- Is it dry in here?

233
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,739
Let me get you some wine.

234
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,449
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

235
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:47,385
These are rock shrimp ravioli
in a cilantro ponzu sauce...

236
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,355
...with just a touch of minced...

237
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,065
...ginger.

238
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,705
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

239
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,772
- These are fantastic!
- Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

240
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,504
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!

241
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,745
That's all there is of these...

242
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,320
...but in a few minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

243
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,553
"Tartlets"?

244
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,523
"Tartlets."

245
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,128
"Tartlets."

246
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,733
Word has lost all meaning.

247
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,042
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

248
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,975
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

249
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,361
Cool! Taco shells!

250
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,834
They're like a little
corn envelope, you know?

251
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,907
- You don't wanna spoil your appetite.
- Hey, Sugar-O's!

252
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,577
You know, if you just wait
another 61 /2 minutes

253
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,408
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

254
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,380
- No, we don't.
- Oh, okay.

255
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,853
Sorry.

256
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,562
Why don't you just have a seat here?

257
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,773
- Give me the gummy bears.
- No.

258
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,838
- Give them to me.
- We'll share.

259
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,539
- No. Give me the bears.
- You can't have any.

260
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,912
It's not worth it!

261
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,987
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

262
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,289
Don't just stand there.
Call 9-1 -1.

263
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,987
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

264
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,169
Help! Help, I'm drowning!

265
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,231
- That's it! Dinner is over!
- What! Why?

266
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,140
Why? What if I came into your office
and I started...?

267
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,376
I can't think of an example.

268
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,040
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...

269
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,881
...and you can't wait 41 /2 minutes
for a tartlet?

270
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,433
So I told him,
"I'm sorry. That's how I feel."

271
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,434
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.

272
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:51,302
Then I said, "Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet."

273
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:57,446
And he didn't listen,
so we left him in the emergency room.

274
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:02,050
- Mon, I'm sorry.
- What a tool.

275
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:07,315
- You did the right thing.
- You don't wanna work for that guy.

276
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,324
I just thought that this was it.

277
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:16,625
- Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.
- Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

278
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,270
Am I gonna get paid
for the full three hours?

279
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:24,033
Just a question.
We'll talk about it later.

280
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,374
So, how did it go with Celia?

281
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:36,047
- I was unbelievable.
- All right, Ross!

282
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,916
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

283
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,854
It was the most elaborate filth
ever heard.

284
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,327
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines, themes, a motif.

285
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,295
At one point, there were villagers.

286
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,399
And?

287
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,170
By the time we finished
all the dirty talk...

288
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,901
...it was late
and we were exhausted

289
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,809
- You cuddled.
- Yeah, which was nice.

290
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,913
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

291
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,817
- Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
- Where the hell is he?

292
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,190
I know what time it is...

293
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,122
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

294
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,731
Let me tell you something.

295
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:26,165
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

296
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,782
How's this?

297
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,286
Sorry. How about over here?

298
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,287
That means it's working.

299
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,618
- Does this hurt?
- No.

300
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,087
How about this?

301
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,897
There you go!

302
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,699
I'm gonna throw up!
