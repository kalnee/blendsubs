2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,504
I don't cry any more, Daryl.

3
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:06,027
Are you okay?

4
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:09,104
Just tired of losing people, so?

5
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:15,211
I'm low on the ammo.

6
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,197
Run by the bus.
I'll cover you.

7
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,015
Beth!
Where is Beth?

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,965
I'm just trying to find the kids,
to get them on the bus.

9
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:24,392
We gotta go back.

10
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:26,002
We gotta go.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,803
We aren't the only survivors.

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,485
We can't be.

13
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,078
Come on.

14
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:30,332
Come on.

16
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,925
I need a drink.

17
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:22,766
No, I mean a real drink.

18
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,936
As in alcohol.

19
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:32,875
I've never had one.

20
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,411
'Cause of my dad.

21
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,847
But he's not exactly
around anymore, so...

22
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,122
I thought we could
go find some.

23
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,666
Okay.

24
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,870
Well, enjoy your snake jerky.

25
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:23,992
Jerk.

26
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,886
I think we made it a way.

27
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,855
I'm pretty sure we got to go
that way to find the booze.

28
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:32,191
What the hell?

29
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:33,826
You brought me back.

30
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,528
I'm not staying
in this suck-ass camp.

31
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,731
Hey!
You had your fun.

32
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,867
What the hell is wrong with you?
Do you feel anything?

33
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,369
Yeah, you think
everything's screwed.

34
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,837
I guess that's a feeling.

35
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,739
So you want to spend
the rest of our lives

36
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,874
staring into a fire
and eating mud snakes?

37
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,843
Screw that.

38
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,746
We might as well do something.

39
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,615
I can take care of myself

40
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,883
and I'm gonna get a damn drink.

41
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,075
Golfers like to
booze it up, right?

42
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,383
Come on.

43
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,334
Might be people inside.

44
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,429
Come on.

45
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,960
Why are you keeping
all that stuff?

46
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:05,935
<i>Come on.</i>

47
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:26,839
Thanks for the help.

48
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,008
You said you could
take care of yourself.

49
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,010
You did.

50
00:16:57,444 --> 00:17:01,031
_

51
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:09,251
_

52
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:26,488
Help me take her down.

53
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,223
It don't matter.
She's dead.

54
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,591
It does matter.

55
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,534
Here.

56
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,389
Okay.

57
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:11,531
Move.

58
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:36,547
We made it.

59
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,653
I know you think
this is stupid.

60
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:45,355
And it probably is.

61
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,992
But I don't care.

62
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:50,294
All I wanted to do today
was lay down and cry,

63
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,696
but we don't get to do that.

64
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:56,066
So beat up on walkers if
that makes you feel better.

65
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:59,836
I need to do this.

66
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,966
Did you have to
break the glass?

67
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:33,135
No.

68
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:35,705
You have your drink yet?

69
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,707
No.

70
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,842
But I found this.

71
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:45,147
Peach schnapps.

72
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:47,349
- Is it good?
- No.

73
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:52,821
Well, it's the only thing left.

74
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:25,353
Who needs a glass?

75
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,910
Ain't gonna have
your first drink

76
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,678
be no damned peach schnapps.

77
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,151
Come on.

78
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:44,672
<i>A motorcycle mechanic.</i>

79
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:47,808
- Huh?
- That's my guess.

80
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,177
For what you were doing
before the turn.

81
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,313
Did Zack ever guess that one?

82
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:53,881
It don't matter.

83
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:56,116
Hasn't mattered
for a long time.

84
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:58,418
It's just what
people talk about,

85
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
you know, to feel normal.

86
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,623
Yeah, well, that never
felt normal to me.

87
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,331
Found this place with Michonne.

88
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:16,302
I was expecting a liquor store.

89
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,304
No, this is better.

90
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:37,757
What's that?

91
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,394
Moonshine.

92
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,163
Come on.

93
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:16,227
All right.

94
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:21,365
That's a real
first drink right there.

95
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:27,071
What's the matter?

96
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,605
Nothing.

97
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:32,043
It's just...

98
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,645
my dad always said bad moonshine
can make you go blind.

99
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,114
Ain't nothing worth seeing
out there anymore anyway.

100
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:49,092
That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever tasted.

101
00:24:58,436 --> 00:25:00,636
Second round's better.

102
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:02,305
Slow down.

103
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:04,975
- This one's for you.
- No, I'm good.

104
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:08,445
- Why?
- Someone's got to keep watch.

105
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,146
So, what, you're like
my chaperone now?

106
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:12,082
Just drink lots of water.

107
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,117
Yes, Mr. Dixon.

108
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:26,161
Who'd go into a store
and walk out with this?

109
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:29,198
My dad, that's who.

110
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,166
<i>Oh, he's a dumbass.</i>

111
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:33,469
He'd set those up
on top of the TV set,

112
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,471
use them as target practice.

113
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:37,473
He shot things
inside your house?

114
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:40,275
It was just a bunch
of junk anyway.

115
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,344
That's how I knew
what this place was.

116
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:45,647
That shed out there, my dad
had a place just like this.

117
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:47,816
You got your Dumpster chair.

118
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:51,753
That's for sitting in and your
drawers all summer drinking.

119
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:53,855
Got your fancy buckets.

120
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:55,857
That's for spitting chaw in

121
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:58,159
after your old lady
tells you to stop smoking.

122
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:02,130
You got your internet.

123
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:15,009
- It's just one of 'em.
- Should we get it?

124
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,011
If he keeps making
too much noise, yeah.

125
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:21,048
Well, if we're gonna
be trapped again,

126
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,150
we might as well
make the best of it.

127
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,922
Unless you're too busy
chaperoning, Mr. Dixon.

128
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,661
Hell, might as well
make the best of it.

129
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:45,172
Home, sweet home.

130
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:53,956
So first I say something
I've never done

131
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,958
and if you have done it,
you drink,

132
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,226
and if you haven't, I drink.

133
00:26:58,228 --> 00:27:00,995
Then we switch.

134
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:03,331
You really don't
know this game?

135
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,733
I never needed a game
to get lit before.

136
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,535
Wait, are we starting?

137
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:10,305
- How do you know this game?
- My friends played.

138
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:13,507
I watched.
Okay, I'll start.

139
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:18,111
I've never shot a crossbow.

140
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:20,080
So now you drink.

141
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:22,817
Ain't much of a game.

142
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,919
That was a warm-up.
Now you go.

143
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,423
I don't know.

144
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:32,792
Just say the first thing
that pops into your head.

145
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:35,428
I've never been out of Georgia.

146
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,866
Really?
Okay, good one.

147
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:44,537
I've never...

148
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,006
been drunk and did
something I regretted.

149
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:54,447
I've done a lot of things.

150
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:58,317
Your turn.

151
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:02,321
I've never been on vacation.

152
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:03,890
What about camping?

153
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,026
No, that was just something
I had to learn to hunt.

154
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,295
Your dad teach you?

155
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:11,197
Mm-hmm.

156
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:14,333
Okay.

157
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,307
I've never...

158
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,710
been in jail.

159
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:27,880
I mean, as a prisoner.

160
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,687
Is that what you think of me?

161
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:37,155
I didn't mean anything serious.

162
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:39,757
I just thought, you know,
like the drunk tank.

163
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,860
Even my dad got locked up
for that back in the day.

164
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:44,996
- Drink up.
- Wait.

165
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:46,531
Prison guard.

166
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,199
Were you a prison guard before?

167
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,870
No.

168
00:28:55,974 --> 00:28:57,975
It's your turn again.

169
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,615
I'm gonna take a piss.

170
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,954
You have to be quiet.

171
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,755
Can't hear you!
I'm taking a piss!

172
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:13,257
Daryl, don't talk so loud.

173
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,825
What, are you my chaperone now?

174
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:21,332
Oh, wait.

175
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,300
It's my turn, right?

176
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:25,269
I've never--

177
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:29,038
never eaten frozen yogurt.

178
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,374
Never had a pet pony.

179
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:34,010
Never got nothing
from Santa Claus.

180
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,947
<i>Never relied on anyone</i>
<i>for protection before.</i>

181
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:39,549
Hell, I don't think I've ever
relied on anyone for anything.

182
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:41,852
- Daryl.
- <i>Never sung out in front of a big group</i>

183
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:44,787
out in public
like everything was fun.

184
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:47,190
Like everything was a big game.

185
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,794
I sure as hell never cut my
wrists looking for attention.

186
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:59,134
Sounds like our friend out there is
trying to call all of his buddies.

187
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:02,404
- Daryl, just shut up.
- Hey, you never shot a crossbow before?

188
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:04,072
I'm gonna teach you right now.

189
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:06,208
Come on.
It's gonna be fun.

190
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,578
We should stay inside.
Daryl, cut it out!

191
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,247
- Daryl!
- Dumbass.

192
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:14,917
Come here, dumbass.

193
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,551
- Daryl.
- You want to shoot?

194
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,653
- I don't know how.
- Oh, it's easy.

195
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:20,355
Come here.
Right corner.

196
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,690
Let's practice later.

197
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:24,926
- Come on, it's fun.
- Just stop it.

198
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:27,295
- Daryl!
- Come here.

199
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:32,734
- Eight ball.
- <i>Just kill it!</i>

200
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:34,802
Come here, Greene.
Let's pull these out.

201
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:37,005
Get a little more
target practice.

202
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:42,610
What the hell you do that for?
I was having fun.

203
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:44,646
No, you were being a jackass.

204
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,881
- If anyone found my dad--
- Don't.

205
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:48,516
That ain't remotely the same.

206
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:51,018
Killing them is not
supposed to be fun.

207
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,953
What do you want
from me, girl, huh?

208
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,756
I want to you stop acting like you
don't give a crap about anything.

209
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:58,092
Like nothing
we went through matters.

210
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:01,095
Like none of the people we
lost meant anything to you.

211
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:03,664
It's bullshit!

212
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,733
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I know.

213
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,735
You don't know nothing.

214
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:11,137
I know you look at me and you
just see another dead girl.

215
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:14,708
I'm not Michonne. I'm not Carol.
I'm not Maggie.

216
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,643
I've survived
and you don't get it

217
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:19,813
'cause I'm not
like you or them.

218
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:23,149
But I made it and you don't
get to treat me like crap

219
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:25,251
just because you're afraid.

220
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:30,557
I ain't afraid of nothing.

221
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:34,094
I remember.

222
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:38,397
When that little girl
came out of the barn

223
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,365
after my mom.

224
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:43,703
You were like me.

225
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,672
And now God forbid

226
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:48,874
you ever let anybody
get too close.

227
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:51,877
Too close, huh?
You know all about that.

228
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:55,214
You lost two boyfriends,
you can't even shed a tear.

229
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:57,583
Your whole family's gone, all you can
do is just go out looking for hooch

230
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:58,984
like some dumb college bitch.

231
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:00,385
Screw you.
You don't get it.

232
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:01,987
No, you don't get it!

233
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:04,590
- Everyone we know is dead!
- You don't know that!

234
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:07,192
Might as well be, 'cause you
ain't never gonna see 'em again.

235
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,897
Rick. You ain't never
gonna see Maggie again.

236
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,100
- Daryl, just stop.
- No!

237
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,070
The Governor rolled
right up to our gates.

238
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:25,543
Maybe if I wouldn't
have stopped looking.

239
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,745
Maybe 'cause I gave up.
That's on me.

240
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:29,614
- Daryl.
- No--

241
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,487
And your dad.

242
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,527
Maybe-- maybe I could
have done something.

243
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:09,707
I get why my dad
stopped drinking.

244
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:12,276
You feel sick?

245
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:13,844
Nope.

246
00:33:15,313 --> 00:33:18,014
I wish I could feel
like this all the time.

247
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:19,950
That's bad.

248
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,485
Hmm.

249
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:23,454
You're lucky
you're a happy drunk.

250
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,089
Yeah, I'm lucky.

251
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:29,025
Some people can be
real jerks when they drink.

252
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:32,595
Yeah, I'm a dick
when I'm drunk.

253
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:44,807
Merle had this dealer.

254
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:47,843
This janky little white guy.

255
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:49,912
A tweaker.

256
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,016
One day we were
over at his house

257
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:55,785
watching TV.

258
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:01,991
Wasn't even noon yet
and we were all wasted.

259
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:05,294
<i>Merle was high.</i>

260
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:07,696
We were watching this show

261
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:11,000
and Merle was talking
all this dumb stuff about it.

262
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,402
And he wouldn't let up.

263
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:15,370
Merle never could.

264
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,909
Turns out

265
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:23,512
it was the tweaker's
kids' favorite show.

266
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:26,848
And he never sees his kids,

267
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,151
so he felt guilty
about it or something.

268
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:35,290
So he punches
Merle in the face.

269
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:38,659
So I started hitting
the tweaker, like, hard.

270
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,529
As hard as I can.

271
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,965
Then he pulls a gun,

272
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:45,766
sticks it right here.

273
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,637
He says, "I'm gonna
kill you, bitch."

274
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,006
So Merle pulls his gun on him.

275
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,309
Everyone's yelling.
I'm yelling.

276
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,948
I thought I was dead.

277
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:07,354
Over a dumb cartoon
about a talking dog.

278
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,462
How'd you get out of it?

279
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,834
The tweaker punched me
in the gut.

280
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,669
I puked.

281
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:26,272
They both started laughing
and forgot all about it.

282
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:33,380
You want to know
what I was before all this?

283
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:39,418
I was just drifting
around with Merle...

284
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:44,590
doing whatever he said we
were gonna be doing that day.

285
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,431
I was nobody.

286
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:57,135
Nothing.

287
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:02,441
Some redneck asshole

288
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:06,144
and an even bigger
asshole for a brother.

289
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:14,920
You miss him, don't you?

290
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:19,324
<i>I miss Maggie.</i>

291
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:24,262
I miss her bossing me around.

292
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:28,265
I miss my big brother Shawn.

293
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:32,804
He was so annoying
and overprotective.

294
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,175
And my dad.

295
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:41,446
I thought--

296
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:44,081
I hoped he'd just live the rest
of his life in peace, you know?

297
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:51,588
I thought Maggie and Glenn
would have a baby.

298
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:56,260
And he'd get to be a grandpa.

299
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:59,863
And we'd have birthdays
and holidays

300
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:01,932
and summer picnics.

301
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:08,004
And he'd get really old.

302
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,978
And it'd happen,
but it'd be quiet.

303
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:20,950
It'd be okay.

304
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:27,223
He'd be surrounded
by people he loved.

305
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:48,543
That's how unbelievably
stupid I am.

306
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,617
That's how
it was supposed to be.

307
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:03,925
I wish I could just...

308
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,260
change.

309
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:08,195
You did.

310
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:10,264
Not enough.

311
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,366
Not like you.

312
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:15,436
It's like you were made
for how things are now.

313
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:18,205
I'm just used to it,
things being ugly.

314
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:20,742
Growing up
in a place like this.

315
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,878
Well, you got away from it.

316
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,581
- I didn't.
- You did.

317
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,584
Maybe you got to keep on
reminding me sometimes.

318
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,786
No.

319
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,322
You can't depend on anybody
for anything, right?

320
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,295
- I'll be gone someday.
- Stop.

321
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:43,897
I will.

322
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,603
You're gonna be
the last man standing.

323
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:55,308
You are.

324
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:05,418
You're gonna miss me so bad
when I'm gone, Daryl Dixon.

325
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,757
You ain't a happy drunk at all.

326
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,560
<i>Yeah, I'm happy.</i>
<i>I'm just not blind.</i>

327
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,933
You got to stay who you are,

328
00:39:20,935 --> 00:39:22,602
not who you were.

329
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:27,739
Places like this,

330
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,975
you have to put it away.

331
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:34,679
What if you can't?

332
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:36,148
You have to.

333
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:40,252
Or it kills you.

334
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:51,896
Here.

335
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,740
We should go inside.

336
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,315
We should burn it down.

337
00:40:31,036 --> 00:40:33,870
We're gonna need more booze.
