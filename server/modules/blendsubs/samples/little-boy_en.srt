1
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:03,827
<i>This is O'Hare, California.</i>

2
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:12,671
<i>Back then, it was nothing more
than a sleepy fishing village</i>

3
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,540
<i>with a hill at the end
of Main Street.</i>

4
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>Like you see
in postcards.</i>

5
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:25,285
<i>- My story takes place
on the home front,</i>

6
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:28,155
<i>in the midst
of World War II.</i>

7
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,526
<i>That's me...</i>

8
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:34,429
<i>the little fella.</i>

9
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:39,034
Closer?

10
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:41,537
Stop causing trouble,
you midget.

11
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,609
<i>Nobody in that town
liked me much.</i>

12
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,350
<i>One, two, three.</i>

13
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:57,922
<i>I was eight years old.</i>

14
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:01,659
<i>But the story really starts
the day I met my dad.</i>

15
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:05,831
<i>My only friend.</i>

16
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,300
<i>My partner.</i>

17
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,637
- He's a boy.
- Wow.

18
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,640
- He's so...
- What? Little?

19
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:17,378
Well, he'll grow.
Right?

20
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,662
I got you covered, okay?

21
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:34,330
<i>'Cause we're partners.</i>

22
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:42,473
<i>I wanted to be
just like him.</i>

23
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,508
<i>And do everything
he did.</i>

24
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:52,217
<i>And everything we did
became a great adventure.</i>

25
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:57,156
<i>Very proud
of you, partner.</i>

26
00:02:57,158 --> 00:02:59,158
You handled the pain
like a true hero.

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,696
Actually, you remind me
of another hero...

28
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:05,532
"Ben Eagle,
The Magician. "

29
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:09,470
Ben Eagle said to his sidekick,
"Do you believe you can do this?"

30
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,806
<i>"Do you believe
you can do this?"</i>

31
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,076
<i>That became our motto.</i>

32
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:23,887
- Do you believe we can do this?
- Yes, I believe we can do this.

33
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:26,256
Let's go, partner.

34
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:32,597
The mast is broken.

35
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,665
Partner, do you believe
you can do this?

36
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,702
Yes, I believe
I can do this.

37
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:39,171
<i>This is the police.</i>

38
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:41,506
Partner, do you believe
we can do this?

39
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:43,710
Yes, partner.

40
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:47,046
Pepper.
Pepper Flynt Busbee,

41
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,348
I've been yelling
for 20 minutes.

42
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,084
<i>That's my mom.</i>

43
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,052
Come on, we're in the
middle of a great story.

44
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:54,788
<i>Always there to snap us
back to reality.</i>

45
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,659
It's time to go to bed.

46
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,595
Come on.

47
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:04,133
<i>And that's my brother,
London.</i>

48
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:08,471
<i>Finally old enough to sign up
for the fight.</i>

49
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:11,975
<i>- Bye, Mom. - All was
good in the old Busbee home.</i>

50
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,881
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

51
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:31,163
The new "Ben Eagle"!

52
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,502
You gotta bring your quarter
for a look-see.

53
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:37,604
- What are you having, your usual today?
- Yeah, give me the usual.

54
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:39,773
Me too.

55
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:43,077
<i>The war was still raging.</i>

56
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,846
<i>The enemy has
infiltrated the USA.</i>

57
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:48,450
<i>Stupid American,
you know not what Tokyo do.</i>

58
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:51,119
Not on my watch,
little fella.

59
00:04:55,526 --> 00:05:00,463
<i>Everyone was pitching in,
doing their part.</i>

60
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:03,600
<i>Uncle Sam had all
the teens lining up,</i>

61
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,969
<i>ready to fight.</i>

62
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,705
<i>Busbee, London.</i>

63
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,143
Sorry, son.
4F.

64
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,613
Hoffman, William.

65
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,817
Sergeant, sir?

66
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,552
With all due respect,

67
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,021
what do flat feet have
to do with killing Japs?

68
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,524
That's just
the way it is, kid.

69
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:26,326
Thanks.

70
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:29,796
<i>Welcome to the US Army.</i>

71
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:32,567
<i>Landry, Gene.</i>

72
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:37,840
<i>How's the weather
down there, "Midget"?</i>

73
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,042
Two vanillas.

74
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:43,045
Hey, the world looks bigger
from down here.

75
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,382
He sure is small.

76
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,717
Hey, where's your cane,
"Tiny Tim"?

77
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,895
You think you're gonna
buy 'em this time?

78
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:59,898
No, not today.

79
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,584
Piece of junk!

80
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,358
<i>4F.
Stupid war.</i>

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,895
I can't let you do this, Dad.
This is my fight.

82
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:28,431
<i>But you always knew
one of us had to go.</i>

83
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,367
It was supposed
to be me.

84
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:40,977
Come on, Lon. Aren't you
gonna eat anything?

85
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,188
London's not going to war,
right?

86
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:12,414
Does that mean that...
you're going instead?

87
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,216
Yes.

88
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,754
He'll be back
before you know it.

89
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,092
Why can't we
stay together?

90
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,527
Partner,
I have to go.

91
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,064
I don't want you to go.

92
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:41,113
Time's up, privates.

93
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,409
You have nothing
to blame yourself about.

94
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:09,913
- You take care of yourself, okay?
- All right.

95
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:42,184
I'm not
a midget, right?

96
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,187
We shouldn't
use that word.

97
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:48,592
"Midget" is a mean word
for people with dwarfism.

98
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:51,762
I'm afraid your son had something
to do with the nickname.

99
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,031
<i>- Mom!
- That's okay, Pepper.</i>

100
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:57,869
I will make sure Freddy
makes things right.

101
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,681
Any news from James?

102
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:12,018
He should be here on the 15th. He said
his tour would end by summer.

103
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,854
That's what he said
in his last letter.

104
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,363
Do I have dwarfism
or what?

105
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,367
You know what?
Let's just keep an eye on you.

106
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,869
You know, it's really too soon
to make any type of diagnosis.

107
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,372
I will, however,
suggest

108
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:32,809
we see each other
regularly.

109
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:36,245
But for now, Pepper,
let's just say you're a...

110
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:40,117
little boy.

111
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,495
Teacup!

112
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:52,263
Come on, get up.

113
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:57,203
<i>Mr. Jones yelled
at me yesterday.</i>

114
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,405
He really blew a fuse
about his car.

115
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,675
He said you were a...

116
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,444
<i>- You want to know what
he called you? - No, I don't.</i>

117
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,651
<i>Let's hear this baby hum.</i>

118
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,874
Why is this thing
not working?

119
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:33,377
The old one works fine.
Your dad was happy with it.

120
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,279
What do you know?

121
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,315
He's gonna love this.

122
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:40,986
Now mind your own and get
the lousy Packard ready.

123
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,457
- Can I go?
- Yeah, go.

124
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,292
Don't need your
pestering, either.

125
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:48,628
- And what about my money?
- I don't have any.

126
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,299
- But mom told you.
- "But mom told you. "

127
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,802
<i>This ain't time to be
spending money like that.</i>

128
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:10,219
What a waste.

129
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,834
Dad's been eyeing these boots
for a long time, hasn't he?

130
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,702
Yes, he has.

131
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:27,539
Thank you.

132
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:37,483
Hi, Jenny. Can I have two tickets
for the "Ben Eagle Show"?

133
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:40,019
Does this mean your
father's coming back?

134
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,457
Yeah, he should be here soon.
Bye, Jenny. Thank you.

135
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:59,575
Good morning, Mrs. Busbee.

136
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:05,148
On March 11th,
your husband,

137
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,717
<i>James L. Busbee</i>

138
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,019
<i>was part of
a tactical operation.</i>

139
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,890
<i>His platoon was sent
to secure Malabang,</i>

140
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,225
<i>a village
in the Philippines.</i>

141
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,777
I can't wait to see him.
He's the best.

142
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:36,417
Hey, look. It's the midget
who ratted on me.

143
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,358
- Come on, let's get him!
- Get him!

144
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,965
Fight!

145
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,883
Midget!
Midget!

146
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:09,588
Midget! Midget!
Midget! Midget!

147
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,392
Stop!
We can't call him "midget. "

148
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,096
It could traumatize him.

149
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,403
Gimme that.

150
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,252
In the name of the
freakiest thing alive,

151
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:38,989
I baptize you,
"Little Boy. "

152
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,428
Okay.
Okay.

153
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:48,833
Is my husband
dead or alive?

154
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:52,771
<i>We don't know, ma'am.
His body wasn't located at the scene.</i>

155
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,340
<i>We believe he's been taken
as a prisoner of war.</i>

156
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,385
<i>Good luck getting out.</i>

157
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:37,622
What's wrong?

158
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:40,427
He's barely eaten
all week.

159
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,963
Just take him,
would you?

160
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:50,738
He got the extra ticket
for your dad.

161
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,509
Fine.

162
00:16:56,946 --> 00:17:01,251
<i>Elegant in his top hat
and floating cane,</i>

163
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,920
<i>Ben Eagle, the magician...</i>

164
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,391
<i>...is in reality...</i>

165
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,530
<i>a super crime fighter!</i>

166
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,600
<i>In today's episode,</i>

167
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:19,504
<i>is Tyra finally safe
from the clutches of Sir Pent?</i>

168
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,356
Hey!
Going for a drink.

169
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:38,993
But the live show
is next.

170
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,029
<i>This is what happens</i>

171
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:44,800
to Ben Eagle's
precious interest.

172
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,402
You'll never get
away with it.

173
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:49,038
What are we gonna do?
There are too many.

174
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,041
Interpretation,
Kid Falcon.

175
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,976
I hope this works.

176
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,456
Ben Eagle!

177
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,894
Ben Eagle!

178
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:19,139
And now,
the moment of truth.

179
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,177
I am searching.

180
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:29,017
Searching for the one who
the High Lama of Tibet told me

181
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,888
<i>would be
in this very room.</i>

182
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,757
The chosen one.

183
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,292
Me!
Me!

184
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,663
You.

185
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:46,871
Look who's here.

186
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,643
London.
My boy.

187
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:55,114
<i>- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, London. The usual?</i>

188
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:59,385
<i>What you are about to see
is not an illusion.</i>

189
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:03,156
You will bear witness
to a profound experience.

190
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:06,760
The movement
of an inanimate object

191
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:09,063
through inner power.

192
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,665
But I'm not gonna perform it.

193
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,067
My new colleague will.

194
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,535
Now you have the power.

195
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:45,705
It's up to you

196
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:47,173
to achieve the impossible.

197
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:53,013
But they're gonna
make fun of me.

198
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:56,883
Not if you move the bottle,
they won't. You just do as I say.

199
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:02,323
Raise your hands and
point them at the bottle.

200
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,791
There.

201
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,462
Get off the stage, runt!

202
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:09,164
Ignore the world.
Ignore the world.

203
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,869
<i>- Focus.
- Stand up, little boy.</i>

204
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,073
<i>- He is standing.
- Get him a step stool.</i>

205
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,720
Do you believe
you can do this?

206
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:32,124
<i>Partner, do you believe
you can do this?</i>

207
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,472
<i>Do you believe you
can move it, yes or no?</i>

208
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,879
Yes, I believe
I can move the bottle.

209
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:54,549
- I don't believe you.
- Yes, I believe I can move it!

210
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:58,053
- Louder.
- Yes! I can move the bottle!

211
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:42,504
<i>That's the kind of faith
that Moses had</i>

212
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:44,239
<i>when he parted
the Red Sea...</i>

213
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:46,809
<i>the kind of faith that
little David had</i>

214
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,679
<i>when he defeated Goliath
with a little stone.</i>

215
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:53,115
<i>That's what we need,
my friends, in these difficult times.</i>

216
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:55,986
<i>So like Father Oliver
used to ask,</i>

217
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,821
<i>"What can we do?</i>

218
00:21:57,823 --> 00:22:00,424
What can we do
for our relatives at war?

219
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:04,295
<i>What can we do
if we are here</i>

220
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:07,265
<i>and they are there?</i>

221
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:10,469
And the answer is...

222
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:14,373
<i>if we have faith the size
of a mustard seed,</i>

223
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,476
we can move a mountain.

224
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:19,145
<i>If we can move
a mountain,</i>

225
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:21,281
<i>then nothing will be
impossible for us.</i>

226
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:25,219
Not even ending this war

227
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:26,954
and having
our loved ones back.

228
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:36,399
<i>I already knew someone
who could move a mountain.</i>

229
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:39,168
<i>I wondered if the source
of his powers</i>

230
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,538
<i>was the mustard seed.</i>

231
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:02,094
<i>This was a source
of unlimited powers?</i>

232
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:08,468
<i>So if this was true,
this was all I needed to...</i>

233
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:16,744
<i>And there he was...</i>

234
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:18,846
<i>the enemy.</i>

235
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,585
- London!
- What?

236
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:25,688
There's a Jap at Gilliam's.

237
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,928
<i>I couldn't understand how
one of them was free in O'Hare.</i>

238
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,699
<i>After Pearl Harbor,
they put them all in camps.</i>

239
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:41,306
<i>After years of internment,
the Army, in its wisdom,</i>

240
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:43,942
<i>has decided to release
those of Japanese ancestry</i>

241
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:46,478
<i>who have proven loyal
to the US.</i>

242
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,951
<i>They seem harmless, don't they?
But can we trust them?</i>

243
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:54,220
<i>Well, I for one,
remember Pearl Harbor,</i>

244
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:57,024
<i>so I say,
"Remain vigilant. "</i>

245
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:11,474
Store doesn't serve Japs.

246
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:16,913
Everything okay here?

247
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,288
You forgot the onions,
Hashimoto.

248
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,658
- Put these on my tab.
- Father, with all due respect...

249
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,160
Now, Gilliam.

250
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:32,998
<i>- These too.
- Of course, Father.</i>

251
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,201
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing
again and again and again

252
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:40,106
about Pearl Harbor and about how my
son "gave his life for his country. "

253
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,310
Because he didn't.

254
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:48,683
<i>Those Japs took his life.</i>

255
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:52,086
And they did it in the most
cowardly way you can imagine.

256
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,261
We need to do something
about that Jap.

257
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:04,934
<i>If I could, I would smash
every Jap with my bare hands.</i>

258
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,105
That's the rat's dump.

259
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:42,443
You want to smash him
with your bare hands, huh?

260
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,316
Here you go.
Have at him.

261
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:52,622
Go on.

262
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,984
There he is!

263
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:27,028
Take that, dirty Jap!

264
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:33,435
Maybe this'll
let him know

265
00:26:33,437 --> 00:26:35,504
that "slants"
ain't welcome...

266
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:41,478
<i>I finally understood
why they don't let flat feet</i>

267
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,913
<i>into the Army.</i>

268
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:10,444
<i>Five groups of 10 "Hail Marys"
and five "Our Fathers. "</i>

269
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,546
In Latin.

270
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:22,290
Amen.
Now you.

271
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,695
In Latin?

272
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,632
Thank God nothing
happened to Hashimoto.

273
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:35,339
- I've finished.
- Very good.

274
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:37,074
Something else?

275
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:39,744
<i>The seed itself
doesn't do anything.</i>

276
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:42,680
<i>What I said is,
"If you have faith,</i>

277
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:45,885
- the invisible power"...
- Like Ben Eagle's powers?

278
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:46,986
"Ben Eagle"?

279
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,159
Well, no,
that's just fantasy.

280
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:03,271
<i>How can you say that?</i>

281
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:05,239
<i>I met Ben Eagle
and he showed me</i>

282
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:08,010
how to move a bottle.

283
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:10,412
He can also move a mountain,
just like you said.

284
00:28:10,414 --> 00:28:12,381
No, no, no.
That's not the same thing.

285
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:15,518
<i>That's not faith.
Let's see.</i>

286
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,688
<i>If you have faith,
"fides" in Latin...</i>

287
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,926
Crispin,
I'll take it from here.

288
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,996
<i>I understand.</i>

289
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:31,369
Take a seat.

290
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:40,880
Why don't you show me
how you moved the bottle?

291
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:45,719
- You want to see?
- Yes, I do.

292
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,478
I guess that
was stupid of me.

293
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,520
Why don't you try again?

294
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,361
Again.

295
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:13,652
There, it moved.

296
00:30:13,654 --> 00:30:16,890
No, you moved it.

297
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:20,193
Yes, because you moved
me to move it.

298
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,662
See, I moved it because

299
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:24,899
you wanted the bottle
to move so much.

300
00:30:24,901 --> 00:30:28,102
And that, you could say,
is how faith works.

301
00:30:29,504 --> 00:30:31,940
At least some of the time.

302
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:35,410
And this is as much as I need
to move a mountain?

303
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:40,783
In theory, yes.

304
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:44,287
But it's up to Him.

305
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,722
He's the mover.

306
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:48,292
How could I get
bigger faith?

307
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:04,810
The list,
the ancient list.

308
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:07,581
For centuries, people believed
that if you do this list,

309
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,217
it'll make your
faith powerful.

310
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:13,454
This is what
you have to do.

311
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,290
"Feed the hungry,

312
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,926
shelter the homeless,

313
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:21,930
visit those in prison,

314
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:25,501
- clothe the naked. "
- Naked?

315
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:28,505
How is that
supposed to...

316
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:31,608
"Visit the sick,

317
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,543
bury the dead. "

318
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:39,817
Oh, just
one more thing.

319
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,020
In order to make this
list work for you,

320
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,989
I'm gonna add

321
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:48,193
one essential item.

322
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,470
"Befriend Hashimoto"?!
Are you crazy?

323
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:58,305
It's your choice,
Pepper.

324
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:02,142
What does that Jap
have to do with anything?

325
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:03,278
Everything.

326
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:08,016
Your faith won't work

327
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:11,554
if you have even the slightest
bit of hatred in you.

328
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,796
Fine.
I'll do it

329
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:21,731
if that's what it takes
to bring my dad back.

330
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:26,804
- Come again?
- Bring my dad back.

331
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,977
Yes, but only
if it's God's will.

332
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:35,147
Why wouldn't God want
to bring my dad back?

333
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,754
I don't know.

334
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:45,491
But if I get enough faith,
nothing's impossible, right?

335
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,966
Yeah.

336
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,565
What do you want?

337
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:53,002
I'm sorry about
the other day.

338
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,913
So, were you
nice to him?

339
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,884
Yeah. How can anyone
be friends with a Jap?

340
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:11,089
<i>Take him a gift,
as a peace offering.</i>

341
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:21,702
Hey, Jap.

342
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:28,242
Want a soda?

343
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,933
And all he did was
throw it in the trash.

344
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:22,504
Oh, I think
you'll be okay.

345
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:27,877
- Hang out with him.
- Hang out?

346
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:30,946
Yep.
Just get to know him.

347
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,756
<i>Ollie, why are you getting me
involved in this?</i>

348
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:43,327
<i>I just don't see
how this helps anyone.</i>

349
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:47,099
<i>Yes, yes, he did,</i>

350
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:51,804
but I don't even
drink soda.

351
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:55,141
Jeez.
Just tell the kid to stop.

352
00:35:56,277 --> 00:35:58,344
Oh, no, he's back again.

353
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:03,918
Hey!

354
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,654
What are you doing
monkeying around my house?

355
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:08,623
I want to hang out.

356
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,092
Go hang out
somewhere else.

357
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:13,862
I meant with you.

358
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:31,583
Okay.
Let's "hang out. "

359
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,758
Come on, get in,
"Little Boy. "

360
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:44,598
Bad nicknames travel fast
in this town.

361
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,267
My family knows
where I am.

362
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,469
Especially London.

363
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,355
Okay,
let's hang out.

364
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,567
Go ahead,
I'll meet you inside.

365
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,702
No, no.

366
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,940
Okay.

367
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,881
What's he doing here?

368
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:35,088
Come.

369
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:49,338
What can I get you?

370
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,106
I'll have a chocolate
sundae with...

371
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:52,808
Hey, I ain't
talking to you, Nip.

372
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,784
What do you want,
Little Boy?

373
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:04,522
Two scoops of vanilla.

374
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:16,469
I haven't had
ice cream in years.

375
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,907
Why are you eating
my ice cream?

376
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:23,978
You can get
ice cream anytime.

377
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,679
Next time,
try chocolate.

378
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:34,155
- Now are we finished
hanging out? - Mm-hmm.

379
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:36,725
Then can I scratch you
from my list?

380
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:41,564
- What list?
- Father Oliver's "ancient list. "

381
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,336
No, Ollie.

382
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,607
You told the boy that
if he waves a magic wand,

383
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:53,578
he can bring his father back.
You don't believe that, do you?

384
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,514
Maybe.
Maybe not.

385
00:39:00,186 --> 00:39:04,923
If it's God's will, yes.
He can do anything.

386
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,327
He could turn you into
a rabbit if He wanted to.

387
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:10,597
Have faith, Hashimoto.
You should try it.

388
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,702
Oh, not again.

389
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:17,705
I do have faith.

390
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:19,440
Faith in oneself.

391
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,710
Not in your imaginary
friend in the sky.

392
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:27,482
Let's hope this
little game of yours

393
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:30,019
doesn't mess
with the boy's mind.

394
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:36,460
Two weeks?
But what about the list?

395
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:38,962
I already finished
with the Jap.

396
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:40,330
Really?

397
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,466
We're friends now.

398
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:45,870
You continue
with Mr. Hashimoto

399
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:48,606
till I can't see the hate
in your eyes anymore.

400
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:55,147
Go and visit a prisoner.
You already know one.

401
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,489
I'll help you with
the list when I get back.

402
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:05,293
I promise.

403
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:27,384
Befriend that rat in order
to get dad back?

404
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:30,387
By doing this stupid list?

405
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:34,826
By befriending him, all you're
doing is betraying Dad.

406
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,542
<i>Hey!</i>

407
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:50,878
Where do you think
you're going, Little Boy?

408
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,631
Come on.

409
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,741
Jap lover!

410
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,152
You can drop me off here.

411
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:53,417
I don't have anyone
to help me with my list.

412
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:05,932
Hmm.
Okay.

413
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:09,435
First things first...

414
00:43:09,437 --> 00:43:12,172
my name is not "Jap. "

415
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:18,012
It's Hashimoto.

416
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:23,551
Hmm?

417
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:32,127
All right, come in.

418
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:58,992
Okay, come.

419
00:43:58,994 --> 00:44:01,829
Show me what you got.

420
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:09,504
Oh.
Where do we start?

421
00:44:09,506 --> 00:44:12,273
"Visit those in prison. "

422
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,978
Why is this crossed out?

423
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,447
My brother.

424
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:20,850
Well... at least that schmuck
was good for something.

425
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:23,620
"Visit the sick. "

426
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:26,123
I can help you
with that one.

427
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:30,194
Okay, just wait
for me over here.

428
00:44:33,365 --> 00:44:36,067
I'm here for my
monthly check-up.

429
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:39,071
Who's your friend?

430
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:46,246
<i>- He's not my friend.
- Thank you.</i>

431
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:51,385
Pepper.
Come on.

432
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:54,755
He's "not his friend. "

433
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,782
Hi.

434
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:24,823
I was just visiting.

435
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:42,510
You can keep it.

436
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:46,848
<i>Thanks, kid.</i>

437
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,622
"Shelter the homeless. "

438
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:57,060
Is that one-eared oaf
still working at the shop?

439
00:45:57,062 --> 00:45:59,095
- Teacup?
- Hmm.

440
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:02,132
<i>Yeah, he sleeps there.</i>

441
00:46:03,435 --> 00:46:06,637
Not quite a home, right?

442
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,675
What about London's
vacant bed?

443
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:18,818
Hey, they fit.

444
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,320
I've never worn
one of these before.

445
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:25,792
It feels... nice.

446
00:46:25,794 --> 00:46:28,228
Then I guess you can
keep 'em, Teacup.

447
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:44,313
The next one...

448
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,017
"Clothe the naked. "

449
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:51,855
Hmm, "spider ladies. "

450
00:46:51,857 --> 00:46:55,293
<i>They "knit and bite" all day.</i>

451
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:03,835
Shouldn't you
be somewhere,

452
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:05,871
playing with sticks
or something,

453
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:08,575
with your friends?

454
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,977
He has no friend.

455
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:22,724
You put these two...

456
00:47:34,238 --> 00:47:36,540
I think the baby's
gonna like it.

457
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:37,941
Thank you.

458
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:43,247
<i>With Hashimoto's help,</i>

459
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:46,951
<i>I'd finished the list
in no time.</i>

460
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:50,288
<i>And maybe he wasn't
so bad after all.</i>

461
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:55,194
<i>Things were looking up.</i>

462
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:58,365
<i>Good afternoon, Mrs. Busbee.</i>

463
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:02,269
I took the liberty of stopping
by today because I...

464
00:48:02,271 --> 00:48:03,903
<i>I heard
about your husband</i>

465
00:48:03,905 --> 00:48:05,539
and...

466
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,576
get your hat off.

467
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:11,279
Mrs. Busbee, I want you
to know if you need anything,

468
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,982
you can count on me.

469
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:17,886
Thank you, Dr. Fox.

470
00:48:17,888 --> 00:48:20,056
Yeah.

471
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:23,660
Boy, it smells good
in here.

472
00:48:23,662 --> 00:48:27,231
Is that a casserole I smell?

473
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,832
It is.

474
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:30,801
Yeah, I thought
I could...

475
00:48:32,904 --> 00:48:35,540
Would you like
to join us?

476
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:39,744
Yeah.

477
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:44,583
Seems Dr. Fox always
gets what he wants.

478
00:48:44,585 --> 00:48:46,952
Dr. Fox?

479
00:48:46,954 --> 00:48:49,656
This is great.
Thank you so much.

480
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:51,024
Here we go.

481
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,898
<i>Mmm.</i>

482
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:02,438
Emma...
Freddy and I

483
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,474
haven't eaten
like this since,

484
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:08,677
well, Clarice passed.

485
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:24,496
Um...

486
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,398
thank you for getting me
out of jail.

487
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,067
No trouble at all, son.

488
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,404
I would do anything
for your mother.

489
00:49:31,406 --> 00:49:34,273
<i>That's my dad's seat,
you know.</i>

490
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:39,813
<i>I can see why.</i>

491
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:41,882
Best view in the house.

492
00:49:44,652 --> 00:49:46,821
<i>May I be excused?</i>

493
00:49:46,823 --> 00:49:48,957
Yes, you may.

494
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:18,190
Hey!
What are you doing...

495
00:50:18,192 --> 00:50:22,195
I heard about your
stupid "magic list. "

496
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:24,230
And if you want it back,

497
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:26,666
you're gonna have to
get it from me.

498
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,929
But that was the list...
the ancient list.

499
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:53,597
I need that one.

500
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,332
If you need it so bad,
take it back from him.

501
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:58,470
How?
He's bigger than me.

502
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,840
Everybody's
bigger than me.

503
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,249
Okay, stand up.

504
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:12,686
Let's see
how small you are.

505
00:51:13,855 --> 00:51:17,791
Hmm, right.

506
00:51:17,793 --> 00:51:20,862
You're a very
small boy, indeed.

507
00:51:20,864 --> 00:51:24,599
Toothpick arms,
cricket legs...

508
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:27,603
size of Masao Kume.

509
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:35,345
- Who's Masao...
- Kume.

510
00:51:35,347 --> 00:51:37,747
<i>- Samurai.
- What's that?</i>

511
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:43,220
You don't know
what a samurai is?

512
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:48,493
Oh, these
are samurai...

513
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:51,129
Japanese warriors.

514
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:54,165
What one's Masao Kume?

515
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:57,470
Hmm. This
is Masao Kume.

516
00:51:57,472 --> 00:52:01,407
- He doesn't look like a warrior.
- He wasn't.

517
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,576
Not yet.

518
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,825
<i>Masao Kume was small.</i>

519
00:52:16,827 --> 00:52:19,428
<i>Powerless.</i>

520
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,664
<i>Nothing but a servant.</i>

521
00:52:24,235 --> 00:52:27,437
But in every man's life,

522
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,906
there comes a day of truth.

523
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:32,109
And that day came

524
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:36,080
when the Mongols
invaded Japan.

525
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:38,884
Who are the Mongols?

526
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:40,752
<i>They were bullies.</i>

527
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:46,025
<i>Samurai tried
to defend their land,</i>

528
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:50,964
<i>but Mongols had
"Bukha the Immense. "</i>

529
00:53:27,574 --> 00:53:31,777
The Mongols issued
a challenge.

530
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:35,982
If anyone could defeat
Bukha in battle,

531
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:39,085
they would leave Japan,
never to return.

532
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,724
<i>Masao Kume believed</i>

533
00:54:12,726 --> 00:54:16,461
<i>that nothing was more
powerful than the will.</i>

534
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:55,606
The will to face
one's fear...

535
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:59,777
and to act.

536
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,022
Stand.

537
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:13,893
Now don't measure yourself
from here to the floor.

538
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:17,364
Measure yourself
from here to the sky.

539
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:22,536
That makes you
the tallest boy in town.

540
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,684
Hey, Freddy.

541
00:56:04,686 --> 00:56:07,321
<i>- Huh? - Look. Someone's
giving you the stink eye.</i>

542
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,159
Looking for something...

543
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,095
<i>Little Boy?</i>

544
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:17,666
Maybe this.
It's a magic list, right?

545
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:19,000
Give it back.

546
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:23,206
Please?

547
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:37,956
You fat motherless pig!

548
00:56:44,731 --> 00:56:47,533
Ugh!
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy!

549
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:49,135
This'll teach you
to never mess with me.

550
00:56:49,137 --> 00:56:51,304
<i>Freddy, Freddy, Freddy!</i>

551
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:55,308
<i>Freddy, Freddy,
Freddy, Freddy...</i>

552
00:56:57,312 --> 00:56:59,146
Freddy, Freddy!

553
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,589
I'm finishing you this time.

554
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:37,590
"Invite a friend over. "

555
00:57:37,592 --> 00:57:41,194
Feed the hungry also means
inviting a friend to eat.

556
00:57:58,448 --> 00:58:02,452
...box and whacked
him so hard.

557
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:07,324
I'll get it.

558
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:15,634
Good day, Mrs. Busbee.

559
00:58:17,737 --> 00:58:21,473
I seem to have made
a mistake.

560
00:58:21,475 --> 00:58:23,810
Would you wait there
a moment?

561
00:58:23,812 --> 00:58:24,911
Yes.

562
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:31,552
I said for you
to invite a friend.

563
00:58:32,787 --> 00:58:35,422
<i>He is my friend.</i>

564
00:58:42,198 --> 00:58:44,133
There's been
no mistake.

565
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:46,035
<i>Please come in,
Mr. Hashimoto.</i>

566
00:58:46,037 --> 00:58:48,070
Thank you,
Mrs. Busbee.

567
00:58:56,347 --> 00:59:00,818
Do you have hot dogs
in Japan, Mr. Hashimoto?

568
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,554
No, Mrs. Busbee.

569
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:12,432
It's been 42 years
since I've been in Japan.

570
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:16,970
Seems like a lifetime ago.

571
00:59:18,906 --> 00:59:20,307
And do you still have
relatives over there?

572
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:23,878
All I have left
of all my relatives

573
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,180
is a photo
of my two nephews

574
00:59:26,182 --> 00:59:27,916
Takeshi and Koji.

575
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:36,392
<i>They probably live
in my hometown still.</i>

576
00:59:36,394 --> 00:59:39,095
<i>Haven't heard
from them since...</i>

577
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:44,168
The war changed everything.

578
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:48,540
Yes, it has.

579
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:50,809
For everyone.

580
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:56,515
And did they send you away
to the camps?

581
00:59:56,517 --> 00:59:58,617
Pepper, that is not the
kind of question you ask.

582
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:01,420
No, no, Mrs. Busbee,
it's okay.

583
01:00:04,192 --> 01:00:06,626
It's simple.

584
01:00:06,628 --> 01:00:09,897
I have the face
of the enemy.

585
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:12,733
Doesn't matter
if this is my home.

586
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:16,037
Doesn't matter if I love
this land, this country...

587
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:17,439
<i>Mom, where's that
other set of keys?</i>

588
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:20,042
That lamebrain
Teacup forgot...

589
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:41,700
- Maybe we should...
- Yes, I'll help you clean up.

590
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:45,337
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

591
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,046
Sorry.

592
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,430
London?

593
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:10,166
London, what are you doing?
Put that down right now.

594
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:13,202
London, put it down
right now. Please?

595
01:01:13,204 --> 01:01:14,604
<i>London,
think about your dad.</i>

596
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:16,439
Get out.

597
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:18,341
London, think about
what you're doing.

598
01:01:18,343 --> 01:01:21,411
Please stop.
Stop.

599
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:24,048
Mrs. Busbee.

600
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:27,218
Pepper.

601
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,657
Get out now.

602
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:34,026
Or I'll shoot you
where you stand.

603
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:39,265
Get out!

604
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:54,015
A Jap will not eat
at my father's table.

605
01:01:54,017 --> 01:01:56,184
This is all your fault!

606
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:58,588
Dad had to go to war
because you couldn't!

607
01:02:02,025 --> 01:02:04,393
Listen to me. If I see you
hanging out with that rat,

608
01:02:04,395 --> 01:02:07,264
- I will smack you in front
of everyone... - Enough!

609
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:14,772
You need to stop
this nonsense.

610
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,608
Stop what?
Stop an eight-year-old boy

611
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,843
from thinking that he can do
something to help his dad?

612
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:21,880
Tell me, London,
what is so wrong with that?

613
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:24,083
Nothing.

614
01:02:24,085 --> 01:02:27,754
Except for when the day comes
to tell him the Japs killed his father.

615
01:02:29,357 --> 01:02:32,492
Stop saying
your dad is dead.

616
01:02:34,863 --> 01:02:37,365
- Mom, I'm just trying to be prepared.
- Oh, shut up.

617
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:53,349
Look at that.

618
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,960
You should go home now.

619
01:03:01,962 --> 01:03:04,062
Is this man bothering you?

620
01:03:04,064 --> 01:03:06,097
No.

621
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:08,233
He's my friend.

622
01:03:08,235 --> 01:03:09,835
Look, I have no
business here with you.

623
01:03:09,837 --> 01:03:11,937
All due respect,
I'm going my way.

624
01:03:11,939 --> 01:03:14,907
With all due respect, you're not
going anywhere just yet.

625
01:03:16,277 --> 01:03:19,279
<i>Am I a joke to you?</i>

626
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:21,248
Listen to me, if I see you
around my brother again,

627
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,518
I will put a bullet in your head.
Do you understand me?

628
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,788
That won't be needed. I think
"Mr. Buddha-head" here understands.

629
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:30,558
You got one week to pack your crap
and get your yellow hide out of here.

630
01:03:32,462 --> 01:03:34,296
What, you don't
believe me?

631
01:03:34,298 --> 01:03:36,332
You stay and find out.

632
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,336
Hey, listen to me.
You want to do something for Dad,

633
01:03:39,338 --> 01:03:41,538
then you stop palling
around with this rat.

634
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,007
Stupid priest filling your head
with a bunch of fairy tales.

635
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:47,812
What if I can?
What if I can bring Dad back?

636
01:03:47,814 --> 01:03:51,716
Dad back?
How?

637
01:03:51,718 --> 01:03:53,952
How are you gonna bring
Dad back, you idiot?

638
01:03:53,954 --> 01:03:57,289
Like... like,
with the mustard seed.

639
01:03:57,291 --> 01:04:00,259
You can
"move a mountain. "

640
01:04:13,575 --> 01:04:15,477
Fine.

641
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:22,084
You want to move a mountain?
There's one. Go ahead.

642
01:04:22,086 --> 01:04:25,454
Move it.
Move it!

643
01:04:27,491 --> 01:04:30,093
Move it for everyone!

644
01:04:30,095 --> 01:04:31,495
You don't have to do it.

645
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:34,364
He's just trying
to humiliate you.

646
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:37,235
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

647
01:04:37,237 --> 01:04:39,904
Not now.
No.

648
01:04:39,906 --> 01:04:42,006
Calm down.

649
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,809
That's it.

650
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:26,224
Get clear!
Get clear!

651
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,975
Do you know when
Father Oliver's coming back?

652
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:43,144
- That's the little boy.
- Right.

653
01:06:43,146 --> 01:06:47,516
- This was much more than just
an earthquake. - What was it?

654
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:49,552
It's a miracle.

655
01:06:51,723 --> 01:06:53,990
Let people believe
what they want.

656
01:06:53,992 --> 01:06:57,761
They need crap like this to believe that
there's something bigger than them.

657
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:00,932
Truth is, that earthquake would have
happened whether that boy was there or not.

658
01:07:03,336 --> 01:07:06,271
I've been walking to work
for 35 years

659
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:09,241
and I'm telling you,
that mountain

660
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:11,543
was definitely...

661
01:07:11,545 --> 01:07:15,381
more to the right.
Right?

662
01:07:15,383 --> 01:07:16,683
Father Oliver?

663
01:07:16,685 --> 01:07:18,885
What? What?
Yes, I heard about it on the...

664
01:07:18,887 --> 01:07:20,921
No, a boy
moved a mountain.

665
01:07:20,923 --> 01:07:23,090
He moved a what?

666
01:07:52,658 --> 01:07:55,593
I figured it out!

667
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:57,229
Hashimoto!

668
01:08:01,234 --> 01:08:06,172
Japan is practically
straight in front of us.

669
01:08:06,174 --> 01:08:09,776
Now if you point to where
the sun touches the sea,

670
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:13,214
you'd be pointing
directly at Japan.

671
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,922
- Why the sudden interest?
- I need to end the war.

672
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:23,692
My dad can't come back
until it's over.

673
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:27,830
You mean doing this?

674
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:29,699
Yes.

675
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:32,603
All right, maybe it's time
I'm honest with you.

676
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:35,472
I don't believe that
you moved any mountain

677
01:08:35,474 --> 01:08:37,875
or you had anything
to do with the earthquake.

678
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:40,812
You were there.
How could you say that?

679
01:08:40,814 --> 01:08:43,114
I just don't believe
that anyone in the world

680
01:08:43,116 --> 01:08:45,350
could do such a thing.

681
01:08:48,655 --> 01:08:51,590
Then are you saying
I should stop?

682
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:59,533
I would say do what
makes sense for you.

683
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:17,053
<i>It's just a loan,
for goodness' sake.</i>

684
01:09:17,055 --> 01:09:19,556
<i>A loan from that Fox
has enough strings</i>

685
01:09:19,558 --> 01:09:21,324
<i>- to start a puppet factory.
- And what do you suggest, then, huh?</i>

686
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:24,762
Lose your father's shop?

687
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:27,698
We can pay him back
when your dad gets home.

688
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,336
I think Dr. Fox is counting
on Dad never coming home.

689
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,408
And his loan required you
to get all dolled up, huh?

690
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:45,419
Today is me and your dad's
wedding anniversary.

691
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:59,769
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

692
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,170
What's Little Boy doing?

693
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,644
I do believe men can
move mountains, Ollie.

694
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:40,247
With dynamite.

695
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,684
<i>I believe that what
happened to the mountain</i>

696
01:10:42,686 --> 01:10:45,754
can't be reduced
to a game of chance.

697
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:49,325
Much of life is
a gamble, Ollie.

698
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,530
You're advising
a desperate child

699
01:10:54,532 --> 01:10:58,468
<i>who's ready to believe
anything that he is told.</i>

700
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:00,704
<i>So tell me, Ollie...</i>

701
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:03,508
<i>...what happens when
your imaginary friend</i>

702
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:07,111
<i>works in His
mysterious ways</i>

703
01:11:07,113 --> 01:11:10,115
and his father dies?

704
01:11:10,117 --> 01:11:12,852
Then my "imaginary friend"

705
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:15,154
will also help him
through it.

706
01:11:15,156 --> 01:11:18,458
Tell the kid to stop.

707
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,728
If he doesn't, could lose
faith in himself.

708
01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:25,366
That's what you should
be worrying about.

709
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,197
- Said it in the papers.
- Little Boy.

710
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,568
That's Little Boy!

711
01:12:58,506 --> 01:13:00,107
There he is!

712
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,476
<i>Little Boy's here.</i>

713
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:05,080
<i>- You did it!
- You did it, son.</i>

714
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:06,915
<i>- Yes, you did.
- He has no idea.</i>

715
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:09,351
<i>Go on, go on,
read it to him.</i>

716
01:13:09,353 --> 01:13:13,022
Give me that.
Listen to this, Little Boy.

717
01:13:13,024 --> 01:13:16,826
"The greatest power known
to man has been unleashed.

718
01:13:16,828 --> 01:13:19,863
<i>Yesterday
at 5:15 our time,</i>

719
01:13:19,865 --> 01:13:23,934
Hiroshima was destroyed by
the force of the atomic bomb,

720
01:13:23,936 --> 01:13:25,936
codename... "

721
01:13:27,272 --> 01:13:29,707
"Little Boy. "

722
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:37,716
- You did it.
- You did it.

723
01:13:43,225 --> 01:13:45,492
I did it!

724
01:13:45,494 --> 01:13:47,327
My daddy's coming home!

725
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:56,171
I did it!

726
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,912
- You did it, Little Boy.
- My daddy's coming home.

727
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,021
I did it!

728
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:13,891
My daddy's coming home.

729
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:48,030
<i>Did they say
when Dad's coming back?</i>

730
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:57,674
I wish things
were that simple.

731
01:15:00,212 --> 01:15:02,980
Colonel Bob said that

732
01:15:02,982 --> 01:15:06,918
the bomb may not be good
for American prisoners.

733
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,422
What do you mean?

734
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:12,557
It means that the Japanese
may try to harm your dad

735
01:15:12,559 --> 01:15:15,061
in revenge for the bomb.

736
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,499
It wiped out
an entire city.

737
01:16:59,213 --> 01:17:01,916
Hello, Hashimoto.

738
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,522
I warned you.
But you dared stay.

739
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:15,364
And looking
on the bright side,

740
01:17:15,366 --> 01:17:19,569
I ended up
doing you a favor.

741
01:17:19,571 --> 01:17:21,704
<i>It's imprudent</i>

742
01:17:21,706 --> 01:17:24,441
to keep all these traitorous
Japanese souvenirs.

743
01:17:26,912 --> 01:17:30,147
Since we are at war
against Japan.

744
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:34,452
It was evil rats
just like you

745
01:17:34,454 --> 01:17:36,521
who cowardly
murdered my son.

746
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:47,634
The yellow fella don't
take a hint, does he?

747
01:17:55,344 --> 01:17:59,081
Doing this

748
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,684
won't bring back
your son.

749
01:18:17,836 --> 01:18:21,773
Sam.
Sam, that's enough, Sam!

750
01:18:27,514 --> 01:18:32,285
Let's get
outta here. Now!

751
01:18:34,521 --> 01:18:37,858
Sam.

752
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,561
Sam, we can't... we can't just
leave him in there. He's gonna die.

753
01:18:40,563 --> 01:18:44,232
If we're caught here and he dies,
we rot in jail. Do you understand me?

754
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:48,203
Get in the truck.
Get in the truck now!

755
01:18:55,011 --> 01:18:59,349
Okay, you wanna play the hero?
That's your choice.

756
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:03,286
But you better be man enough to face
the consequences on your own.

757
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,862
<i>How is he?</i>

758
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:44,200
His heart is very weak.

759
01:19:44,202 --> 01:19:47,438
But he's gonna be
okay, right?

760
01:19:52,143 --> 01:19:54,512
I don't know.

761
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:41,732
You have to let one die.

762
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:45,270
<i>Make your choice.</i>

763
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,955
Hashimoto.

764
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,258
Hashimoto...?

765
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:12,467
Pepper.

766
01:21:21,512 --> 01:21:23,413
Nurse!

767
01:21:23,415 --> 01:21:26,483
<i>- Get the doctor.
- Dr. Foley!</i>

768
01:21:26,485 --> 01:21:29,320
- I need oxygen.
- Right away.

769
01:21:29,322 --> 01:21:33,124
<i>Mr. Hashimoto, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?</i>

770
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:42,435
He's stopped breathing.

771
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:47,307
Please don't die.

772
01:24:26,388 --> 01:24:29,959
You're free.
The Jap dropped the charges.

773
01:24:29,961 --> 01:24:32,194
Says you saved his life.

774
01:24:32,196 --> 01:24:34,965
Whatever that means.

775
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:37,100
Ma'am.

776
01:25:57,526 --> 01:25:59,627
<i>It's time.</i>

777
01:26:05,735 --> 01:26:09,539
<i>We were told my father was laid
to rest in the Philippines.</i>

778
01:26:12,576 --> 01:26:16,347
<i>My mother still chose to have
a memorial for him back home.</i>

779
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:19,717
<i>Let us commit James L. Busbee's
body to the ground,</i>

780
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:23,021
<i>earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,</i>

781
01:26:23,023 --> 01:26:25,323
<i>dust to dust,</i>

782
01:26:25,325 --> 01:26:28,260
<i>in the sure
and certain hope</i>

783
01:26:28,262 --> 01:26:31,831
<i>of the resurrection
to eternal life.</i>

784
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:36,403
<i>In the name of the Father
and of the Son</i>

785
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:39,439
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</i>

786
01:28:13,614 --> 01:28:16,384
You're my only partner.

787
01:28:58,031 --> 01:28:59,833
Do you mind if I sit here?

788
01:29:19,556 --> 01:29:21,391
You know, I...

789
01:29:21,393 --> 01:29:24,828
never got to say
goodbye to my wife.

790
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:29,200
By the time I got
to the hospital,

791
01:29:29,202 --> 01:29:31,836
she was already
in a coma.

792
01:29:37,243 --> 01:29:40,011
She died
the next morning.

793
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:52,092
I think it was stupid
of me to believe

794
01:29:52,094 --> 01:29:55,262
that a midget like me
could bring my dad back

795
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:57,265
with some stupid list.

796
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,567
It was not stupid.

797
01:29:59,569 --> 01:30:02,237
It takes courage
to believe.

798
01:30:04,975 --> 01:30:08,477
Your father would be
more than proud of you.

799
01:30:11,749 --> 01:30:15,352
All the love you have for him
was contained in that list.

800
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:32,240
I did this for you.

801
01:32:05,912 --> 01:32:08,748
<i>- 39 inches.
- Same as before.</i>

802
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,418
I'm afraid I still
don't have a diagnosis

803
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,121
for his irregular
development,

804
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:17,157
<i>but I do have
some theories.</i>

805
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:20,428
Maybe I could come over
the house later

806
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:23,097
and we could discuss them.

807
01:32:23,099 --> 01:32:24,599
Perhaps tonight?

808
01:32:24,601 --> 01:32:28,504
I really appreciate the help
you've given us.

809
01:32:28,506 --> 01:32:30,639
<i>I really do,</i>

810
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:33,175
but right now,

811
01:32:33,177 --> 01:32:35,245
my family
needs some time alone.

812
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:37,247
Maybe after some time...

813
01:32:37,249 --> 01:32:39,416
You're a good man, Dr. Fox.

814
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:43,020
But I will always be
Mrs. James Busbee.

815
01:32:47,326 --> 01:32:49,528
Come on.

816
01:33:54,904 --> 01:33:57,872
- I need more bandages!
- What's the name on this one?

817
01:33:57,874 --> 01:34:02,010
<i>- I got him, I got him.
- Get that on his head!</i>

818
01:34:03,079 --> 01:34:04,212
"James L. Busbee...

819
01:34:04,214 --> 01:34:07,482
<i>39627771. "</i>

820
01:34:32,779 --> 01:34:35,981
You did it, you little runt.
You did it.

821
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:44,892
<i>London!</i>

822
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:06,450
<i>Father Oliver said God
was responsible</i>

823
01:35:06,452 --> 01:35:08,486
<i>for bringing
my dad back.</i>

824
01:35:12,592 --> 01:35:17,028
<i>Hashimoto said it was
my father's will to live.</i>

825
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:20,099
He survived an extremely
severe trauma.

826
01:35:21,668 --> 01:35:23,769
<i>Me?</i>

827
01:35:25,839 --> 01:35:29,243
<i>Oh, I was holding on
to my mustard seed...</i>

828
01:35:30,945 --> 01:35:33,514
<i>because the journey
was not over yet.</i>

829
01:35:49,367 --> 01:35:51,401
Partner...?

830
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:58,409
I got the boots
you really wanted.

831
01:36:15,596 --> 01:36:17,898
It's me, partner.

832
01:36:49,201 --> 01:36:51,436
Partner.
